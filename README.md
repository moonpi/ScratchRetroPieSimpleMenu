# Scratch Menu for Simple Theme on RetroPie
After trying to port Scratch to RetroPie with no luck, I am leaving the menu for the simple theme here for use by anyone who wants to make a Scratch emulator for RetroPie. Feel free to change the images, etc. 

*This will only make a menu and a rom directory. It is not an emulator.*

Installation
------------
1) Install RetroPie. https://github.com/retropie/retropie-setup/wiki/manual-installation

2) Install the Simple theme on your RetroPie. (That's the only theme that works so far) (If you don't do this, it is not going to be pretty)

```
dpkg-reconfigure x11-common
```
4) Then run installation shell script using one of the following command lines in the terminal:

```sh
curl -L https://goo.gl/j7Uj3f | bash
```

or

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate https://goo.gl/j7Uj3f -O - | bash
