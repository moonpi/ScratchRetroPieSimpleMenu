# Retro Pie Scratch
Phosophorous Scratch Installer Script for RetroPie.
## Untested
After attempting a Scratch 1.4 port and a Scratch 2.0 port on Chromium without much luck, I have decided to try Phosphorous. Let's hope this works. This will only work with an internet connection. (If it works at all)

Installation
------------
Switch your x11 settings to anybody
```
dpkg-reconfigure x11-common
```
Then run installation shell script using one of the following command lines in the terminal:

```sh
curl -L https://goo.gl/j7Uj3f | bash
```

or

```sh
wget --no-check-certificate https://goo.gl/j7Uj3f -O - | bash
```
